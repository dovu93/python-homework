# Working out the steps for PyBank.


1. Need to import data from csv

2. Be able to read the data from csv

3. calculate number of months in data 

    * basically count how many lines of data there are in the csv

4. add up column 2, which is profit/loss

    * need to import the data in column 1 into a list and add up to get a number to understand what the profit/loss is for the timeframe

5. calculate average profit/loss per month

    * Divide the profit/loss by how many months there are

6. find the month with the highest profits

    * find the index with the highest number from the list created in number 4 and give it a value

7. find the month with the highest loss

    * find the index with the lowest number from the list created in number 4 and give it a value

8. print the following

    * Financial Analysis
    
    * Total months
    
    * Total $$
    
    * Average Change: 
    
    * Greatest Increase in Profits: 
    
    * Greatest Decrease in Profits: 
    

9. Find a way to print the above into the terminal

    * use a simple print() command

10. Export the report into a text file. 

    * use a write code? or copy and pase function?
